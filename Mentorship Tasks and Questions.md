*****This Week for Mentorship (11/13)*********

- change materials for buttons instead of using the Destroy and Instantiate method constantly.
- make sure UI is size to screen and not world space.
- state machine; have a third state (triggers when button pressed combination creates a pattern).
- add note being played to a display on the UI.
- make code portable.

- work on hardware (the midi instrument itself (flute)).


**Other things we discussed**

- Pico8 website (simple yet robust game engine).
- Screeps (javascript coding videogame).
- Unity Tutorials.

***Questions Encountered***

- still not able to get UI to scale with screen size (it may just be the editor though).
- getting input from the various button locations into the pattern tracker.

*****Previous Weeks*****

- Use the Unity engine as the base platform.
